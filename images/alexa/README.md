# Adding Your Personal Photos

To add your personal photos to the Valentine's page:

1. Place your photos in this directory (`/public/images/alexa/`)
2. Name them: `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`, etc.
3. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
4. Recommended size: Square photos (1:1 aspect ratio) work best, around 300x300px to 500x500px

The photos will automatically appear on the celebration screen when "Yes" is clicked!

You can add as many photos as you want - just name them sequentially (photo1, photo2, photo3, etc.) and update the `photos` array in `src/Components/Alexa.js` if you add more than 3.
